# Project Scaffold: "luke:app" ([source](../../generators/app/index.js))

This is a "project scaffold" sub-generator that generates a minimal project
scaffold that should be useful as a starting point for most of my projects.
This scaffold/generator is also the default generator and will execute if
no sub-generator is specified.


## Usage Example

```
$ npm install -g yo generator-luke
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
$ yo luke
```

[project scaffold](../project-scaffolds.md) is used/specified:
